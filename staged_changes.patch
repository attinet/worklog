-description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.
----
-
-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Goal
-
-Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.
-
-## Operating Constraints
-
-**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).
-
-**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.
-
-## Execution Steps
-
-### 1. Initialize Analysis Context
-
-Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:
-
-- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
-- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
-- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md
-
-Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
-For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)
-
-Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:
-
-**From spec.md:**
-
-- Overview/Context
-- Functional Requirements
-- Non-Functional Requirements
-- User Stories
-- Edge Cases (if present)
-
-**From plan.md:**
-
-- Architecture/stack choices
-- Data Model references
-- Phases
-- Technical constraints
-
-**From tasks.md:**
-
-- Task IDs
-- Descriptions
-- Phase grouping
-- Parallel markers [P]
-- Referenced file paths
-
-**From constitution:**
-
-- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation
-
-### 3. Build Semantic Models
-
-Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):
-
-- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
-- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
-- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
-- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements
-
-### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)
-
-Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.
-
-#### A. Duplication Detection
-
-- Identify near-duplicate requirements
-- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation
-
-#### B. Ambiguity Detection
-
-- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
-- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)
-
-#### C. Underspecification
-
-- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
-- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
-- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan
-
-#### D. Constitution Alignment
-
-- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
-- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution
-
-#### E. Coverage Gaps
-
-- Requirements with zero associated tasks
-- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
-- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)
-
-#### F. Inconsistency
-
-- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
-- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
-- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
-- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)
-
-### 5. Severity Assignment
-
-Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:
-
-- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
-- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
-- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
-- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order
-
-### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report
-
-Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:
-
-## Specification Analysis Report
-
-| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
-|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
-| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |
-
-(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)
-
-**Coverage Summary Table:**
-
-| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
-|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
-
-**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)
-
-**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)
-
-**Metrics:**
-
-- Total Requirements
-- Total Tasks
-- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
-- Ambiguity Count
-- Duplication Count
-- Critical Issues Count
-
-### 7. Provide Next Actions
-
-At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:
-
-- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`
-- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
-- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /speckit.specify with refinement", "Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"
-
-### 8. Offer Remediation
-
-Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)
-
-## Operating Principles
-
-### Context Efficiency
-
-- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
-- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
-- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
-- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts
-
-### Analysis Guidelines
-
-- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
-- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
-- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
-- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
-- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)

-description: Generate a custom checklist for the current feature based on user requirements.
----
-
-## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for English"
-
-**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR REQUIREMENTS WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain.
-
-**NOT for verification/testing**:
-
-- ❌ NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly"
-- ❌ NOT "Test error handling works"
-- ❌ NOT "Confirm the API returns 200"
-- ❌ NOT checking if code/implementation matches the spec
-
-**FOR requirements quality validation**:
-
-- ✅ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined for all card types?" (completeness)
-- ✅ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" (clarity)
-- ✅ "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" (consistency)
-- ✅ "Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation?" (coverage)
-- ✅ "Does the spec define what happens when logo image fails to load?" (edge cases)
-
-**Metaphor**: If your spec is code written in English, the checklist is its unit test suite. You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.
-
-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Execution Steps
-
-1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.
-   - All file paths must be absolute.
-   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:
-   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks
-   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content
-   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in `$ARGUMENTS`
-   - Prefer precision over breadth
-
-   Generation algorithm:
-   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators ("critical", "must", "compliance"), stakeholder hints ("QA", "review", "security team"), and explicit deliverables ("a11y", "rollback", "contracts").
-   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.
-   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.
-   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.
-   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:
-      - Scope refinement (e.g., "Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?")
-      - Risk prioritization (e.g., "Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?")
-      - Depth calibration (e.g., "Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?")
-      - Audience framing (e.g., "Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?")
-      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., "Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?")
-      - Scenario class gap (e.g., "No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?")
-
-   Question formatting rules:
-   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters
-   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer
-   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said
-   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: "Confirm whether X belongs in scope."
-
-   Defaults when interaction impossible:
-   - Depth: Standard
-   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise
-   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters
-
-   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., "Unresolved recovery path risk"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.
-
-3. **Understand user request**: Combine `$ARGUMENTS` + clarifying answers:
-   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)
-   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user
-   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding
-   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)
-
-4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
-   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope
-   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies
-   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks
-
-   **Context Loading Strategy**:
-   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)
-   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets
-   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected
-   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text
-
-5. **Generate checklist** - Create "Unit Tests for Requirements":
-   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist
-   - Generate unique checklist filename:
-     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)
-     - Format: `[domain].md`
-     - If file exists, append to existing file
-   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001
-   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)
-
-   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:
-   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:
-   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
-   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?
-   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?
-   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
-   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?
-
-   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:
-   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)
-   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)
-   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)
-   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)
-   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)
-   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)
-   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)
-   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)
-   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)
-
-   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - "Unit Tests for English"**:
-
-   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):
-   - "Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards"
-   - "Test hover states work on desktop"
-   - "Confirm logo click navigates home"
-
-   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):
-   - "Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?" [Completeness]
-   - "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" [Clarity]
-   - "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" [Consistency]
-   - "Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?" [Coverage]
-   - "Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?" [Edge Cases]
-   - "Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?" [Completeness]
-   - "Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?" [Clarity]
-
-   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:
-   Each item should follow this pattern:
-   - Question format asking about requirement quality
-   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan
-   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]
-   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements
-   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements
-
-   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:
-
-   Completeness:
-   - "Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]"
-   - "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]"
-   - "Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]"
-
-   Clarity:
-   - "Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]"
-   - "Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]"
-   - "Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]"
-
-   Consistency:
-   - "Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]"
-   - "Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]"
-
-   Coverage:
-   - "Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]"
-   - "Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]"
-   - "Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]"
-
-   Measurability:
-   - "Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]"
-   - "Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]"
-
-   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):
-   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios
-   - For each scenario class, ask: "Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?"
-   - If scenario class missing: "Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]"
-   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: "Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]"
-
-   **Traceability Requirements**:
-   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference
-   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`
-   - If no ID system exists: "Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]"
-
-   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):
-   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:
-   - Ambiguities: "Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]"
-   - Conflicts: "Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]"
-   - Assumptions: "Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]"
-   - Dependencies: "Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]"
-   - Missing definitions: "Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]"
-
-   **Content Consolidation**:
-   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact
-   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect
-   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: "Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]"
-
-   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:
-   - ❌ Any item starting with "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
-   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior
-   - ❌ "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
-   - ❌ "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"
-   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures
-   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)
-
-   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:
-   - ✅ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
-   - ✅ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
-   - ✅ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
-   - ✅ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
-   - ✅ "Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?"
-   - ✅ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"
-
-6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.
-
-7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:
-   - Focus areas selected
-   - Depth level
-   - Actor/timing
-   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated
-
-**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:
-
-- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)
-- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose
-- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder
-
-To avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.
-
-## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items
-
-**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`
-
-Sample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):
-
-- "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]"
-- "Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]"
-- "Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]"
-- "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]"
-- "Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]"
-- "Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]"
-
-**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`
-
-Sample items:
-
-- "Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]"
-- "Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]"
-- "Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]"
-- "Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]"
-- "Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]"
-
-**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`
-
-Sample items:
-
-- "Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]"
-- "Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]"
-- "Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]"
-- "Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]"
-- "Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]"
-
-**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`
-
-Sample items:
-
-- "Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]"
-- "Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]"
-- "Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]"
-- "Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]"
-- "Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]"
-
-## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do
-
-**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**
-
-```markdown
-- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]
-- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]
-- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]
-- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]
-```
-
-**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**
-
-```markdown
-- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
-- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
-- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
-- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
-- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]
-- [ ] CHK006 - Can "visual hierarchy" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]
-```
-
-**Key Differences:**
-
-- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly
-- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly
-- Wrong: Verification of behavior
-- Correct: Validation of requirement quality
-- Wrong: "Does it do X?"
-- Correct: "Is X clearly specified?"

----
-
-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.
-
-Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.
-
-Execution steps:
-
-1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
-   - `FEATURE_DIR`
-   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
-   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
-   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
-   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).
-
-   Functional Scope & Behavior:
-   - Core user goals & success criteria
-   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
-   - User roles / personas differentiation
-
-   Domain & Data Model:
-   - Entities, attributes, relationships
-   - Identity & uniqueness rules
-   - Lifecycle/state transitions
-   - Data volume / scale assumptions
-
-   Interaction & UX Flow:
-   - Critical user journeys / sequences
-   - Error/empty/loading states
-   - Accessibility or localization notes
-
-   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
-   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
-   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
-   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
-   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
-   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
-   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)
-
-   Integration & External Dependencies:
-   - External services/APIs and failure modes
-   - Data import/export formats
-   - Protocol/versioning assumptions
-
-   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
-   - Negative scenarios
-   - Rate limiting / throttling
-   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)
-
-   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
-   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
-   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives
-
-   Terminology & Consistency:
-   - Canonical glossary terms
-   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms
-
-   Completion Signals:
-   - Acceptance criteria testability
-   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators
-
-   Misc / Placeholders:
-   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
-   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification
-
-   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
-   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
-   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)
-
-3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
-    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
-    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
-       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
-       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
-    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
-    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
-    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
-    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
-    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.
-
-4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
-    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
-    - For multiple‑choice questions:
-       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
-          - Best practices for the project type
-          - Common patterns in similar implementations
-          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
-          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
-       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
-       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
-       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:
-
-       | Option | Description |
-       |--------|-------------|
-       | A | <Option A description> |
-       | B | <Option B description> |
-       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |
-       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |
-
-       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
-    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):
-       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
-       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
-       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
-    - After the user answers:
-       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
-       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
-       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
-       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
-    - Stop asking further questions when:
-       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
-       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
-       - You reach 5 asked questions.
-    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
-    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.
-
-5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
-    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
-    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
-       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
-       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
-    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
-    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
-       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
-       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
-       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
-       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
-       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
-       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
-    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
-    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
-    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
-    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).
-
-6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
-   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
-   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
-   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
-   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
-   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
-   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.
-
-7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.
-
-8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
-   - Number of questions asked & answered.
-   - Path to updated spec.
-   - Sections touched (list names).
-   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
-   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.
-   - Suggested next command.
-
-Behavior rules:
-
-- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
-- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
-- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
-- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
-- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
-- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
-- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

----
-
-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.
-
-Follow this execution flow:
-
-1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
-   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
-   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.
-
-2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
-   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
-   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
-   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
-   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
-     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
-     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
-     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
-   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.
-
-3. Draft the updated constitution content:
-   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
-   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
-   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
-   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.
-
-4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
-   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
-   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
-   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
-   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
-   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.
-
-5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
-   - Version change: old → new
-   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
-   - Added sections
-   - Removed sections
-   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
-   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.
-
-6. Validation before final output:
-   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
-   - Version line matches report.
-   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
-   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).
-
-7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).
-
-8. Output a final summary to the user with:
-   - New version and bump rationale.
-   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
-   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).
-
-Formatting & Style Requirements:
-
-- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
-- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
-- Keep a single blank line between sections.
-- Avoid trailing whitespace.
-
-If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.
-
-If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.
-
-Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

-
-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
-   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
-   - For each checklist, count:
-     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
-     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
-     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
-   - Create a status table:
-
-     ```text
-     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
-     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
-     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
-     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
-     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
-     ```
-
-   - Calculate overall status:
-     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
-     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
-
-   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
-     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
-     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
-     - Wait for user response before continuing
-     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
-     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
-
-   - **If all checklists are complete**:
-     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
-     - Automatically proceed to step 3
-
-3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
-   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
-   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
-   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
-   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
-   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
-   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios
-
-4. **Project Setup Verification**:
-   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:
-
-   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
-   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):
-
-     ```sh
-     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
-     ```
-
-   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
-   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
-   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
-   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
-   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
-   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
-   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore
-
-   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
-   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology
-
-   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
-   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
-   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
-   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
-   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
-   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
-   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
-   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
-   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
-   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
-   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
-   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `Makefile`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
-   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`
-   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
-   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`
-
-   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
-   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
-   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
-   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
-   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
-   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`
-
-5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
-   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
-   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
-   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
-   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements
-
-6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
-   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
-   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
-   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
-   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
-   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding
-
-7. Implementation execution rules:
-   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
-   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
-   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
-   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
-   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation
-
-8. Progress tracking and error handling:
-   - Report progress after each completed task
-   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
-   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
-   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
-   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
-   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.
-
-9. Completion validation:
-   - Verify all required tasks are completed
-   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
-   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
-   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
-   - Report final status with summary of completed work
-
-Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).
-
-3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
-   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
-   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
-   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
-   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
-   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
-   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
-   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design
-
-4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.
-
-## Phases
-
-### Phase 0: Outline & Research
-
-1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
-   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
-   - For each dependency → best practices task
-   - For each integration → patterns task
-
-2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
-
-   ```text
-   For each unknown in Technical Context:
-     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
-   For each technology choice:
-     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
-   ```
-
-3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
-   - Decision: [what was chosen]
-   - Rationale: [why chosen]
-   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
-
-**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
-
-### Phase 1: Design & Contracts
-
-**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete
-
-1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
-   - Entity name, fields, relationships
-   - Validation rules from requirements
-   - State transitions if applicable
-
-2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
-   - For each user action → endpoint
-   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
-   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`
-
-3. **Agent context update**:
-   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
-   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
-   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
-   - Add only new technology from current plan
-   - Preserve manual additions between markers
-
-**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.
-
-Given that feature description, do this:
-
-1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
-   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
-   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
-   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
-   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
-   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
-   - Examples:
-     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
-     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
-     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
-     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"
-
-2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:
-
-   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:
-
-      ```bash
-      git fetch --all --prune
-      ```
-
-   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
-      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
-      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
-      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`
-
-   c. Determine the next available number:
-      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
-      - Find the highest number N
-      - Use N+1 for the new branch number
-
-   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "$ARGUMENTS"` with the calculated number and short-name:
-      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
-      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "$ARGUMENTS" --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
-      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1 -Json "$ARGUMENTS" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
-
-   **IMPORTANT**:
-   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
-   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
-   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
-   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
-   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
-   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
-   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")
-
-3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
-
-4. Follow this execution flow:
-
-    1. Parse user description from Input
-       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
-    2. Extract key concepts from description
-       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
-    3. For unclear aspects:
-       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
-       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
-         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
-         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
-         - No reasonable default exists
-       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
-       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
-    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
-       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
-    5. Generate Functional Requirements
-       Each requirement must be testable
-       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
-    6. Define Success Criteria
-       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
-       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
-       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
-    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
-    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
-
-5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
-
-6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:
-
-   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:
-
-      ```markdown
-      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
-      
-      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
-      **Created**: [DATE]
-      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
-      
-      ## Content Quality
-      
-      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
-      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
-      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
-      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
-      
-      ## Requirement Completeness
-      
-      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
-      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
-      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
-      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
-      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
-      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
-      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
-      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
-      
-      ## Feature Readiness
-      
-      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
-      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
-      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
-      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
-      
-      ## Notes
-      
-      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
-      ```
-
-   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
-      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
-      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)
-
-   c. **Handle Validation Results**:
-
-      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6
-
-      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
-        1. List the failing items and specific issues
-        2. Update the spec to address each issue
-        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
-        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user
-
-      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
-        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
-        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
-        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:
-
-           ```markdown
-           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
-           
-           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
-           
-           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
-           
-           **Suggested Answers**:
-           
-           | Option | Answer | Implications |
-           |--------|--------|--------------|
-           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
-           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
-           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
-           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
-           
-           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
-           ```
-
-        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
-           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
-           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
-           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
-           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
-        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
-        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
-        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
-        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
-        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved
-
-   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status
-
-7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).
-
-**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.
-
-## General Guidelines
-
-## Quick Guidelines
-
-- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
-- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
-- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
-- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.
-
-### Section Requirements
-
-- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
-- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
-- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
-
-### For AI Generation
-
-When creating this spec from a user prompt:
-
-1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
-2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
-3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
-   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
-   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
-   - Lack any reasonable default
-4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
-5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
-6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
-   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
-   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
-   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)
-
-**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):
-
-- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
-- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
-- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
-- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
-- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise
-
-### Success Criteria Guidelines
-
-Success criteria must be:
-
-1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
-2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
-3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
-4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details
-
-**Good examples**:
-
-- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
-- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
-- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
-- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"
-
-**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):
-
-- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
-- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
-- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
-- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

-## User Input
-
-```text
-$ARGUMENTS
-```
-
-You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).
-
-## Outline
-
-1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
-
-2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
-   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
-   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
-   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.
-
-3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
-   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
-   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
-   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
-   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
-   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
-   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
-   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
-   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
-   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)
-
-4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
-   - Correct feature name from plan.md
-   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
-   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
-   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
-   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
-   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
-   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
-   - Clear file paths for each task
-   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
-   - Parallel execution examples per story
-   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)
-
-5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
-   - Total task count
-   - Task count per user story
-   - Parallel opportunities identified
-   - Independent test criteria for each story
-   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
-   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
-
-Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS
-
-The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.
-
-## Task Generation Rules
-
-**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.
-
-**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.
-
-### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)
-
-Every task MUST strictly follow this format:
-
-```text
-- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
-```
-
-**Format Components**:
-
-1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
-2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
-3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
-4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
-   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
-   - Setup phase: NO story label
-   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
-   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
-   - Polish phase: NO story label
-5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path
-
-**Examples**:
-
-- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
-- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
-- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
-- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
-- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
-- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
-- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
-- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)
-
-### Task Organization
-
-1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
-   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
-   - Map all related components to their story:
-     - Models needed for that story
-     - Services needed for that story
-     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
-     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
-   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)
-
-2. **From Contracts**:
-   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
-   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase
-
-3. **From Data Model**:
-   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
-   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
-   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase
-
-4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
-   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
-   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
-   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase
-
-### Phase Structure
-
-- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
-- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
-- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
-  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
-  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
-- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

-✅ tasks-template.md - 任務組織支援 TDD 工作流程和品質標準
-
-後續事項：
-- 無 - 所有佔位符已解決
--->
-
-# Worklog 專案憲章
-
-## 核心原則
-
-### I. 程式碼品質標準
-
-所有程式碼必須符合以下品質要求：
-
-- **可讀性優先**：程式碼必須自我說明，變數和函式名稱須清晰表達意圖
-- **模組化設計**：每個函式/方法僅負責單一職責（Single Responsibility Principle）
-- **程式碼審查必要性**：所有變更必須經過程式碼審查才能合併至主分支
-- **文件化要求**：公開 API 必須包含清晰的文件說明，包括參數、回傳值和使用範例
-- **無警告政策**：所有 linter 警告必須解決，不得忽略或停用檢查規則
-
-**理由**：程式碼品質直接影響長期維護成本、團隊協作效率和系統穩定性。高品質的程式碼能減少錯誤、加速新功能開發，並降低技術債務累積。
-
-### II. 測試標準（不可妥協）
-
-測試驅動開發（TDD）為強制要求：
-
-- **測試先行流程**：必須先撰寫測試 → 獲得使用者批准 → 驗證測試失敗 → 才能開始實作
-- **Red-Green-Refactor 循環**：嚴格遵守 TDD 紅燈（測試失敗）→ 綠燈（測試通過）→ 重構的開發循環
-- **測試覆蓋率要求**：
-  - 單元測試：核心業務邏輯覆蓋率須達 80% 以上
-  - 整合測試：所有 API 端點和服務互動必須有整合測試
-  - 契約測試：跨服務溝通和共享結構必須有契約測試
-- **獨立可測試性**：每個使用者故事必須能獨立測試，不依賴其他故事的實作
-- **測試即文件**：測試案例必須清楚展示功能預期行為，作為活文件使用
-
-**理由**：TDD 確保程式碼正確性、促進良好設計、提供回歸測試保護，並作為程式碼行為的權威文件。測試先行能迫使開發者思考介面設計和邊界條件。
-
-### III. 使用者體驗一致性
-
-確保跨功能的一致使用者體驗：
-
-- **優先級導向開發**：使用者故事必須按優先級（P1、P2、P3）排序，P1 代表最關鍵功能
-- **獨立價值交付**：每個使用者故事必須能獨立交付價值，形成可用的 MVP（最小可行產品）
-- **驗收標準明確性**：所有使用者故事必須包含明確的 Given-When-Then 格式驗收情境
-- **邊界情況處理**：必須明確定義錯誤處理、邊界條件和異常情況的使用者體驗
-- **回饋機制**：系統操作必須提供即時、清晰的回饋給使用者
-
-**理由**：一致的使用者體驗能降低學習曲線、減少使用者錯誤、提升使用者滿意度。優先級導向開發確保團隊專注於最有價值的功能。
-
-### IV. 效能要求
-
-所有功能必須符合明確的效能標準：
-
-- **回應時間限制**：
-  - API 端點：P95 延遲 < 200ms
-  - 資料庫查詢：複雜查詢 < 100ms
-  - 頁面載入：首次內容繪製（FCP）< 1.5s
-- **資源使用限制**：
-  - 記憶體使用：單一程序 < 100MB（一般情況）
-  - CPU 使用：平穩負載下 < 50% 單核心
-- **可延展性要求**：系統必須能處理至少 1000 並行使用者而不降級
-- **效能測試強制性**：所有新功能必須包含效能基準測試
-- **監控與警示**：必須設定效能監控和異常警示機制
-
-**理由**：效能直接影響使用者滿意度和系統可用性。明確的效能指標能在開發早期發現問題，避免昂貴的後期優化。
-
-## 品質關卡
-
-所有功能在部署前必須通過以下檢查：
-
-### 程式碼品質關卡
-
-- [ ] 所有程式碼審查意見已解決
-- [ ] Linter 檢查無警告或錯誤
-- [ ] 程式碼覆蓋率符合標準（單元測試 ≥ 80%）
-- [ ] 公開 API 包含完整文件說明
-
-### 測試關卡
-
-- [ ] 所有測試通過（單元、整合、契約測試）
-- [ ] 測試在 CI/CD 管道中執行成功
-- [ ] 邊界情況和錯誤情境有對應測試
-- [ ] 獨立使用者故事測試驗證通過
-
-### 使用者體驗關卡
-
-- [ ] 所有驗收情境通過測試
-- [ ] 錯誤訊息清晰且可操作
-- [ ] 回饋機制正常運作
-- [ ] 無障礙性要求符合（如適用）
-
-### 效能關卡
-
-- [ ] 效能基準測試通過定義的限制
-- [ ] 負載測試結果符合可延展性要求
-- [ ] 記憶體洩漏檢查通過
-- [ ] 監控儀表板設定完成
-
-## 開發工作流程
-
-標準開發流程必須遵循以下步驟：
-
-1. **規格制定**（/speckit.specify）：定義使用者故事、驗收標準和成功指標
-2. **計劃制定**（/speckit.plan）：建立技術方案、架構決策和憲章檢查
-3. **任務分解**（/speckit.tasks）：將功能分解為可追蹤、獨立的任務
-4. **實作執行**（/speckit.implement）：遵循 TDD 循環實作功能
-5. **持續驗證**：在每個檢查點驗證品質、測試、UX 和效能標準
-
-### 分支策略
-
-- 功能分支命名：`[###-feature-name]`（例如：`001-user-auth`）
-- 所有變更通過 Pull Request 合併
-- 主分支必須始終保持可部署狀態
-
-### 提交規範
-
-使用語意化提交訊息（Conventional Commits）：
-- `feat:` 新功能
-- `fix:` 錯誤修復
-- `docs:` 文件變更
-- `test:` 測試相關變更
-- `refactor:` 程式碼重構
-- `perf:` 效能優化
-
-## 治理規則
-
-### 憲章地位
-
-本憲章優先於所有其他開發實踐和慣例。任何與憲章衝突的實踐必須修正或正式提出修訂申請。
-
-### 修訂程序
-
-1. **提議**：任何團隊成員可提出修訂提案，須包含理由和影響分析
-2. **審查**：修訂提案須經團隊審查和討論
-3. **批准**：修訂須獲得團隊共識（或專案負責人批准）
-4. **遷移計劃**：重大變更須包含現有程式碼的遷移計劃
-5. **版本更新**：修訂後更新憲章版本號和修訂日期
-
-### 版本控制政策
-
-憲章遵循語意化版本控制（Semantic Versioning）：
-- **MAJOR**（主版本）：移除或重新定義核心原則，造成向後不相容
-- **MINOR**（次版本）：新增原則或大幅擴充指導方針
-- **PATCH**（修訂版本）：釐清說明、措辭修正、非語意性改進
-
-### 合規性審查
-
-- 所有 Pull Request 必須驗證是否符合憲章要求
-- 任何複雜性例外必須在實作計劃中明確說明並提供理由
-- 定期進行憲章合規性審查（建議每季度一次）
-
-### 執行指引
-
-日常開發指引請參考 `.specify/templates/` 下的範本檔案和 `.github/prompts/` 下的命令指引。

-.SYNOPSIS
-Update agent context files with information from plan.md (PowerShell version)
-
-.DESCRIPTION
-Mirrors the behavior of scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh:
- 1. Environment Validation
- 2. Plan Data Extraction
- 3. Agent File Management (create from template or update existing)
- 4. Content Generation (technology stack, recent changes, timestamp)
- 5. Multi-Agent Support (claude, gemini, copilot, cursor-agent, qwen, opencode, codex, windsurf, kilocode, auggie, roo, codebuddy, amp, shai, q, bob, qoder)
-
-.PARAMETER AgentType
-Optional agent key to update a single agent. If omitted, updates all existing agent files (creating a default Claude file if none exist).
-
-.EXAMPLE
-./update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude
-
-.EXAMPLE
-./update-agent-context.ps1   # Updates all existing agent files
-
-.NOTES
-Relies on common helper functions in common.ps1

-## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
-
-<!--
-  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
-  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
-  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
-  
-  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
-  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
-  - Developed independently
-  - Tested independently
-  - Deployed independently
-  - Demonstrated to users independently

----
-
-# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]
-
-**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
-**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
-
-**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.
-
-**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.
-
-## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
-
-- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
-- Include exact file paths in descriptions
-
-## Path Conventions
-
-- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
-- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
-- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
-- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure
-
-<!-- 
-  ============================================================================
-  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
-  
-  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
-  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
-  - Feature requirements from plan.md
-  - Entities from data-model.md
-  - Endpoints from contracts/
-  
-  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
-  - Implemented independently
-  - Tested independently
-  - Delivered as an MVP increment
-  
-  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
-  ============================================================================
--->
-
-## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)
-
-**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure
-
-- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
-- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
-- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools
-
----
-
-## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
-
-**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented
-
-**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete
-
-Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):
-
-- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
-- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
-- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
-- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
-- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
-- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management
-
-**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
-
----
-
-## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP
-
-**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
-
-**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
-
-### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️
-
-> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**
-
-- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
-- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
-
-### Implementation for User Story 1
-
-- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
-- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
-- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
-- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
-- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
-- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
-
-**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently
-
----
-
-## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)
-
-**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
-
-**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
-
-### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️
-
-- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
-- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
-
-### Implementation for User Story 2
-
-- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
-- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
-- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
-- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
-
-**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently
-
----
-
-## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)
-
-**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
-
-**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
-
-### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️
-
-- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
-- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
-
-### Implementation for User Story 3
-
-- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
-- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
-- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
-
-**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional
-
----
-
-[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]
-
----
-
-## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
-
-**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories
-
-- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
-- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
-- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
-- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
-- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
-- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
-
----
-
-## Dependencies & Execution Order
-
-### Phase Dependencies
-
-- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
-  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
-  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
-- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
-
-### User Story Dependencies
-
-- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
-- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
-- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
-
-### Within Each User Story
-
-- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
-- Models before services
-- Services before endpoints
-- Core implementation before integration
-- Story complete before moving to next priority
-
-### Parallel Opportunities
-
-- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
-- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
-- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
-- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
-- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
-- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
-
----
-
-## Parallel Example: User Story 1
-
-```bash
-# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
-Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
-Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"
-
-# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
-Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
-Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
-```
-
----
-
-## Implementation Strategy
-
-### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
-
-1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
-2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
-3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
-4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
-5. Deploy/demo if ready
-
-### Incremental Delivery
-
-1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
-2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
-3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
-4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
-5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories
-
-### Parallel Team Strategy
-
-With multiple developers:
-
-1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
-2. Once Foundational is done:
-   - Developer A: User Story 1
-   - Developer B: User Story 2
-   - Developer C: User Story 3
-3. Stories complete and integrate independently
-
----
-
-## Notes
-
-- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
-- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
-- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
-- Verify tests fail before implementing
-- Commit after each task or logical group
-- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
-- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

-
-- 本機啟動 API:
-
-```powershell
-cd src\WorkLog.Api
-dotnet run
-```
-
-- 或使用 workspace task `Start API`（task 列表內已定義）
-- 資料庫遷移: 程式啟動時自動執行 `db.Database.Migrate()`；若需手動建立 migration，可使用 workspace 提供的 `EF Core Migration` 或 `Recreate Migration` task
-- 注意: 生產環境請將 `Jwt:Secret` 與連線字串儲存在秘密管理（Key Vault / 環境變數）

-
-## 🔍 關鍵技術解決方案
-
-### 1. Razor 事件處理屬性引號問題
-**問題**: 在 Razor 中傳遞字串參數到事件處理器時，雙引號轉義導致編譯錯誤。
-
-```razor
-❌ 錯誤寫法:
-<MudButton OnClick="@(() => ChangeRole(id, \"Admin\"))">
-
-✅ 正確寫法:
-<MudButton OnClick='@(() => ChangeRole(id, "Admin"))'>
-```
-
-**解決方案**: 使用單引號包裹事件處理器屬性值，內部字串使用雙引號。
-
-### 2. MudCard 事件處理
-**問題**: MudCard 不支援 `OnClick` 參數。
-
-```razor
-❌ 錯誤寫法:
-<MudCard OnClick="@NavigateToPage">
-
-✅ 正確寫法:
-<MudCard @onclick="@NavigateToPage">
-```
-
-**解決方案**: 使用小寫的 `@onclick` 指令 (HTML 原生事件)。
-
-### 3. Dialog 參數傳遞
-**問題**: 如何傳遞參數到 MudDialog 元件。
-
-```csharp
-✅ 正確寫法:
-var parameters = new DialogParameters<CreateUserDialog>
-{
-    { x => x.UserId, userId },
-    { x => x.OnSaved, EventCallback.Factory.Create(this, Refresh) }
-};
-
-await DialogService.ShowAsync<CreateUserDialog>("標題", parameters);
-```
-
-### 4. Calendar 日期樣式
-**問題**: Calendar 元件需要自定義不同狀態的樣式。
-
-```csharp
-✅ 解決方案:
-// 使用 CSS 變數搭配 inline style
-private string GetDateStyle(DateOnly date)
-{
-    if (isSelected)
-        return "background-color: var(--mud-palette-primary-lighten); border: 2px solid var(--mud-palette-primary)";
-    // ...
-}
-```
-
-### 5. MudGrid 7列布局
-**問題**: MudGrid 預設支援 12 列系統，如何實現日曆的 7 列布局。
-
-```razor
-✅ 解決方案:
-<MudGrid Spacing="1">
-    @foreach (var item in items)
-    {
-        <MudItem xs="12/7">  <!-- 12除以7的分數表示法 -->
-            ...
-        </MudItem>
-    }
-</MudGrid>
-```
-
----
-
-## 📝 保留的自定義 CSS
-
-檔案: `wwwroot/css/app.css`
-
-### 保留內容 (~2KB)
-1. **Reset & Base** - 全域重置樣式
-2. **Form Validation** - 表單驗證樣式
-3. **Blazor Error UI** - Blazor 錯誤顯示
-4. **Loading Progress** - 載入動畫
-5. **MudBlazor Enhancements** - MudBlazor 增強樣式
-   - `.hover-card` - AdminIndex 卡片 hover 效果
-   - `.mud-list-item-clickable` - 可點擊清單項目
-   - `.cursor-pointer` - 滑鼠游標指針
-
-### 移除內容 (~13KB)
-- ❌ Tailwind-like utility classes (flex, grid, spacing, colors)
-- ❌ 自定義元件樣式 (btn-primary, input-field, badges)
-- ❌ Calendar 自定義樣式 (calendar-day-* classes)
-- ❌ 響應式 grid utilities
-
----
-
-## 🚀 後續維護建議
-
-### 1. 版本更新
-- 📦 定期更新 MudBlazor NuGet 套件
-- 📖 關注 MudBlazor 官方部落格的重大變更
-- 🔍 查看 [MudBlazor Roadmap](https://mudblazor.com/roadmap)
-
-### 2. 效能優化
-- ✅ 使用 `MudTable` 的虛擬化功能處理大量資料
-- ✅ 適當使用 `MudVirtualize` 元件
-- ✅ 避免在 `@code` 區塊中進行複雜計算
-
-### 3. 無障礙測試
-- ♿ 定期使用螢幕閱讀器測試
-- ⌨️ 確保所有功能可透過鍵盤操作
-- 🎨 驗證對比度符合 WCAG AA 標準
-
-### 4. 客製化建議
-- 🎨 在 `AppTheme.cs` 中調整品牌色彩
-- 📏 使用 `LayoutProperties` 調整間距和圓角
-- 🌗 微調暗色模式配色以符合品牌形象
-
-### 5. 元件使用最佳實踐
-```razor
-✅ 推薦:
-<MudTextField T="string" 
-              @bind-Value="model.Name"
-              Label="名稱"
-              Variant="Variant.Outlined"
-              Required="true"
-              RequiredError="請輸入名稱" />
-
-❌ 避免:
-<MudTextField Value="@model.Name" 
-              ValueChanged="@((string v) => model.Name = v)" />
-```

-## 📋 WorkLog 專案建置指南
-
-### 前置需求
-
-1. **.NET SDK 8.0 或更高版本**
-   ```powershell
-   dotnet --version
-   ```
-
-2. **SQL Server LocalDB**（Windows 自帶）
-   ```powershell
-   sqllocaldb info MSSQLLocalDB
-   ```
-
-3. **Entity Framework Core Tools**
-   ```powershell
-   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
-   ```
-
----
-
-### 方法一：使用提供的腳本（推薦）
-
-#### 🔨 重新建構專案
-```powershell
-.\rebuild.ps1
-```
-此腳本會：
-- 清除所有 `bin` 和 `obj` 資料夾
-- 依序建構 Domain → Shared → Infrastructure → Api
-
-#### 🚀 啟動服務
-```powershell
-.\start.ps1
-```
-此腳本會：
-- 停止舊的服務程序
-- 在新視窗啟動 API 服務（Port 5001）
-- 在新視窗啟動 Web 服務（Port 5003）
-- 自動開啟瀏覽器
-
-#### ⏹️ 停止服務
-```powershell
-.\stop.ps1
-```
-
-#### ⏹️ 快速啟動方式
-
-```dos
-start.bat
-```
-
-```
-
-
----
-
-### 方法二：手動建置
-
-#### 1️⃣ 還原相依套件
-```powershell
-cd d:\開發中\worklog
-dotnet restore WorkLog.slnx
-```
-
-#### 2️⃣ 建構整個解決方案
-```powershell
-dotnet build WorkLog.slnx
-```
-
-或依序建構各專案：
-```powershell
-dotnet build src\WorkLog.Domain\WorkLog.Domain.csproj
-dotnet build src\WorkLog.Shared\WorkLog.Shared.csproj
-dotnet build src\WorkLog.Infrastructure\WorkLog.Infrastructure.csproj
-dotnet build src\WorkLog.Api\WorkLog.Api.csproj
-dotnet build src\WorkLog.Web\WorkLog.Web.csproj
-```
-
-#### 3️⃣ 執行測試（選擇性）
-```powershell
-dotnet test
-```
-
-#### 4️⃣ 啟動後端 API
-```powershell
-cd src\WorkLog.Api
-dotnet run
-```
-API 將在 `https://localhost:5001` 啟動，Swagger 文件位於：`https://localhost:5001/swagger`
-
-#### 5️⃣ 啟動前端 Web（另開視窗）
-```powershell
-cd src\WorkLog.Web
-dotnet run
-```
-Web 將在 `https://localhost:5002` 或 `http://localhost:5003` 啟動
-
-- 或是執行start.bat會同時啟動前後端
----
-
-### 資料庫設定
-
-#### 初始化資料庫
-資料庫會在首次執行時自動建立和遷移（Program.cs 中有 `db.Database.Migrate()`）
-
-#### 手動建立 Migration
-```powershell
-dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate `
-  -p "d:\開發中\worklog\src\WorkLog.Infrastructure\WorkLog.Infrastructure.csproj" `
-  -s "d:\開發中\worklog\src\WorkLog.Api\WorkLog.Api.csproj" `
-  -o Data/Migrations
-```
-
-#### 重置資料庫（清空重建）
-使用提供的 VS Code Task：`Reset Database`
-
-或執行：
-```powershell
-sqllocaldb stop MSSQLLocalDB
-sqllocaldb delete MSSQLLocalDB  
-sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocalDB
-sqllocaldb start MSSQLLocalDB
-```
-
----
-
-### 使用 VS Code Tasks
-
-在 VS Code 中按 `Ctrl+Shift+P`，選擇 "Tasks: Run Task"，可使用：
-
-- **Build Full Solution** - 建構完整解決方案
-- **Start API** - 啟動 API 服務（背景）
-- **Start Frontend** - 啟動前端服務（背景）
-- **Reset Database** - 重置資料庫
-- **Recreate Migration** - 重新建立 Migration
-
----
-
-### 預設帳號
-
-- **帳號**: `admin`
-- **密碼**: 預設 `Admin@123`或請查看資料庫初始化資料或使用 `/api/auth/generate-hash` 端點產生
-
----
-
-### 常見問題
-
-**Q: 建構失敗，提示相依套件錯誤？**
-```powershell
-dotnet clean
-dotnet restore
-dotnet build
-```
-
-**Q: 資料庫連線失敗？**
-確認 LocalDB 正在執行：
-```powershell
-sqllocaldb start MSSQLLocalDB
-```
-
-**Q: Port 被佔用？**
-修改 launchSettings.json 和 launchSettings.json 中的 Port 設定。
-
----
-
-### 快速開始（一鍵啟動）
-
-```powershell
-# 建構 + 啟動
-.\rebuild.ps1
-.\start.ps1
-```
-
-瀏覽器會自動開啟到 `http://localhost:5003`，享受使用！🎉
